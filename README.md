# roomOS
The last life ~~support~~ control system you'll need.

(imagine this is an image placeholder)
<sub>blah blah blah placeholder blah blah.</sub>

RoomOS is a flexible, fast and secure esp32 firmware platform for Home Assistant sensor integration and logging that allows you to monitor and control your room's environmental and aesthetic conditions in a breeze.

## roomOS can:
- Turn your lights on
- Increase or decrease your room's temp
- Put on a movie
- Clean your air
- Tell you the current weather
- Monitor your room's temperature and humidity
- Log and track sensor data
- Show your tasks for today
- And much more!

## Supported Devices
As of now, **roomOS is only being actively developed for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller.** A port to other popular microcontrollers, and possibly a linux app (for SBCs like Raspberry Pis) are in my to-do list, and I will get to them. Eventually.

## Releases
* 1.0.0
    - Work in progress.
